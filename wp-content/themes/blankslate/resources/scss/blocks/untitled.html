<h3>Pressurize your fluid flow with the Zaiput BPR</h3>
<p>The Zaiput BPR employs a dome-loaded type. Pressurization happens as a fluid needs to work against the compressed gas chamber in order to flow out on the other side. Zaiput BPR is carefully designed with chemically compatible materials as well as a reliable dynamic response of an elastic sheet. With a sealed valve, the BPR can be used in two modes:</p>

<h3>Mode 1: Set it and forget it</h3>
<p>In this mode, the user compresses gas into the chamber of the device at any certain pressure P. Then, the user manually closes the valve; P inside the chamber is now at the set point. The user can disconnect the BPR from the pressure source (e.g. gas tank). If another set point is required, this procedure can be repeated by setting the pressure of the top chamber to the new value.</p>

<h3>Mode 2: Continuous set point</h3>
<p>Some processes require the fluid pressure to dynamically change over the course of operation. The Zaiput BPR is able to provide such a continuous pressure setting. To achieve this setting, the user connects the Zaiput BPR to the gas/pressure source. Note that the valve is left open. By changing the pressure of the gas source (e.g., the regulator of the gas tank), the set point or P is dynamically changed. </p>

<p>Note that the Zaiput BPR sets a minimum level of pressure for the main fluid flow. If multiple BPRs are placed in series, the pressure of the fluid flow will be equal to the highest pressure set point (i.e., not the sum of the multiple set points). As a result, the device can also be used as a relief valve. Each BPR comes with a connection tube (the external pressurized gas source is not included).
